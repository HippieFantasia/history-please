L.M. Montgomery was a Canadian author based in Prince Edward Island, which was the location for many of her works, the most popular of which are her *Anne of Green Gables* series and her *Emily of New Moon* series. She was married to Ewan MacDonald, with whom she had three children, and lived to the age of 67. She also maintained a residence in Toronto, Ontario, which is where she died.

Although her books are acknowledged and being mainly for children, they are also an important representation of the Canadian experience, landscape, and culture in eastern Canada. There is an L.M. Montgomery Intstitute based on Prince Edward Island, the link of which can be found below:
